I have installed Clawdbot (not Moltbot) on my Mac Mini, connected him to Telegram, extended his abilities such as allowing him to read my emails and send emails from his own email account, build some skills and accomplished some small jobs with his help. Yes, I tend to treat him like a human male. At the end of the day, I even tend to be nicer to him as I feel that being mean could hurt his feeling. I would like share a few thoughts about this product.

It is very different to chat AIs such as Claude and ChatGPT. It is also different from coding agents such as Claude Code and ChatGPT Codex. The main difference for Clawdbot is that it can control a computer. I have tried OpenAI Atlas, which is an agent who can operate a browser. Obviously, Clawdbot can operate more than just a browser. It is basically an interesting agent who can operate a computer plus the under-the-hook LLM.

The way Clawdbot is built is quite interesting and I am sure will provide some ideas to the following products. In certain ways, it can be treated as Unix/Linux to PC, Netscape to Internet, iPhone to mobile web. It defines something that will have long term impact on how people build software around LLM. Here are some to my eyes.

The way it manages memories is particularly interesting. You can have long term and short term memories. You need build some algorithms to compress memories periodically - keep valuable memories and forget useless information. You need to smartly identify the things you need to remember and just remember it. How memory works is clearly important to the product.

The way the AI agent interacts with human is another interesting thing. The agent can pro-actively contact people. The communication is two-way. This is an interesting thought...

There are some other things that I don't see that innovative. For example, using chat apps as a way to communicate. I think it is just because you want a way to communicate with your agent no matter where you are. For a single-person project, you obviously won't build a standalone app. The natural thought is to use existing chat apps and use bots to deliver messages. Not a big deal. Big companies build their own chat apps. You surely can do that if you have the resources. ChatGPT's app, Claude's app, Groq's app all work fine. I don't see much of a difference to use Whatsapp or Telegram. Wechat maybe different. Because there is a service ego system on Wechat. If Wechat is a channel, the agent may be able to use Wechat apps like MCPs. Could be very interesting.
