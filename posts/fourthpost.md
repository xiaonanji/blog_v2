Our math exams stop testing whether students can calculate complex addition/subtraction/multiplication/division. Why? It is not because they are not important. Calculation is still a critical skill that we use day to day. But if you ask a student to learn how to calculate 273*521, he will be surprised: why do I need to do that by hands? A calculator can do it faster and more accurate.

Now we probably can ask the similar quesiton on coding: why do I still need to test whether you know sorting algorithm? How to use a data structure? How to call a specific API? How to use a web dev framework? AI can do it faster and better.

I know little to none about the modern front end or backend frameworks. I never code in Javascript. But I can still use Codex or Claude to build a simple web app or mobile app. As long as I can describe what I want clearly to AI, it always can give me something useable. Our moment of not needing to know how to code probably arrived already or going to arrive very soon...
